            <h3>Nutrition</h3>
            <p>In terms of Chihuahuas, all care elements are very important to maintain good health, but the most
                important is feeding and diet.
                Chihuahuas should be fed a high-quality dog food fit to the dogs age and if not dog food the breed does
                well with real meats such as
                chicken, lamb, or fish. Vegetables and fruit such as potatoes, peas, carrots, berries, and bananas
                should also be implemented into their
                healthy diet in addition to their meals. Some Chihuahuas are known to be overweight so keep a close eye
                on calories and weight. To learn
                more, please visit

            <h3>Grooming</h3>
            <p>The two coat types of the Chihuahua each have different grooming requirements. The short-hair
                (smooth-coat) Chihuahua is low maintenance as
                they only require minimum brushing and regular bathing. The long-haired chihuahua should be brushed
                weekly and bathrd thoroughly to ensure
                their coat is clean. Both types requirer regular nail trimming, and teeth brushing. Due to Chihuahuas
                large and opened ears it is best to
                check them weekly and clean any visible wax or debri. Also it is best with any dog to check for paw
                injuries or cuts routinely.
            </p>

            <img src="images/care3.jpg" alt="exercise" class="desktop">
            <h3>Exercise</h3>
            <p>Chihuahuas love to run around and play, and due to their small size this requires very little space and
                effort. Daily or weekly walks depending upon
                the dogs health and age will be enough to make sure the dog gets necessary exercise, but sure not to
                overwork the Chihuahua. Keep an eye out for a dog panting
                or having trouble keeping up, if this occurs the dog needs rest and to be hydrated.
            </p>

            <h3>Training</h3>
            <p>Chihuahuas are a very intelligent breed, and are very aware of their surroundings. The are very loyal
                companions and seek to please, so positive reinforcement
                along with firm and proper training will yield desired results. As mentioned Chihuahuas are very
                intelligent, so they are also great at learning to get their way. If this
                occurs be sure to let the dog know you are in charge. When it comes to potty training maintain a tight
                schedule for when the dog should be let out every few hours. Though,
                Chihuahuas are able to hold their needs for about 9 hours without difficulty. To learn more on how to
                train your Chihuahua, please visit

            <img src="images/care5.jpg" alt="Health" class="desktop">
            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p>Chihuahuas are primarily healthy dogs, there are only few genetic issues that may affect the breed. Be
                sure to provide deworming medication to
                your Chihuahua regulary, otherwise parasites may bring upon discomfort and even put your dogs life in
                danger. It's easiest to make a visit to the
                vet, but it can be done at home as well. Chihuahuas should also be vaccinated. To see more about
                vaccinations, please visit the
