                <h2>Strengths</h2>
                <p>
                    Soon to have my bachelors of Computer Science from GVSU, I have accumulated many strengths from my
                    overall
                    academic experiences and accomplishments. I have a unique approach when it comes to problem solving
                    and
                    a determined work ethic. I thrive to make things work despite any arisen odds or difficulties faced.
                    Also, many assigned
                    group projects has allowed for me to gain the necessary communication and collaborate skills for the
                    work field.

                    A recent coding competition with consultant company Atomic Object displayed that I operate very well
                    in stressful conditions.
                    Also that I know how to take a strong leadership role when necessary to assure the proper work is
                    accomplished when working
                    in a team. I think outside the box when assigned tasks that require serious mental effort, and
                    possess an open mind to new ideas and constructive criticism.
