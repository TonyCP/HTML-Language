                <h3> PART 1</h3>
                <p>
                    Choosing to attend Grand Valley State University was the best decision in my life.
                    I am very proud of myself and the young adult I have grown into over the years at
                    this school. I am grateful for the assistance Grand Valley State University has
                    provided me with from the very moment I began attending. I was welcomed with open
                    arms not only by my peers, but also by the outstanding staff the school provides.

                <h3> PART 2</h3>
                <p>
                    My college academic experience and in school accomplishments have readily prepared me
                    to enter the field as a computer programmer. Throughout my years at Grand Valley State
                    University, I have maintained a GPA above 2.9 and have received letters of recognition for
                    making the deanâ€™s list for two consecutive years (2015-2017).

                <h3> PART 3</h3>
                <p>
                    I am expected to graduate in the Spring of 2021 and will finish strong. Along my academic experience
                    I have had the opportunities to work with two inspiring professors, Dr. Samah Mansour and Dr.
                    Ferguson. Originally a business major, I found a passion for programming during my
                    freshman year through the completion of one computing course which sparked an interest.

                <h3> PART 4</h3>
                <p>
                    With the help of Dr. Mansour, who provided more insight on the major of computer science
                    and Dr. Ferguson, who was not only a professor but a mentor as well, who guided me in the
                    right direction with the use of constructive criticism, I knew computer science was the
                    major for me. Since then, I have taken a very active role in the continuation of developing
                    my passion as a programmer.
